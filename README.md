leancli - A task manager for the command line
=============================================

taskjuggler is nice, but a bit too much for what i need.
Time for a new project! And as i wanted to learn Rust for
some month now, here we are!

This is work in progress. I have just started this project,
so there isn't much to see yet. Use at your own risk ;)
